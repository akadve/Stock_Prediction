# Stock Price Prediction with EDA

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using past data and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. EDA is a crucial step in any data analysis process, as it helps understand the data, identify patterns, and uncover insights that can inform the modeling and prediction process.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model for stock prices using historical data. The EDA process involves:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Deriving new features from existing data that may be relevant for prediction.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing and analyzing the data to uncover patterns, trends, and potential relationships between features and the target variable (stock price).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical stock data, including features such as:

- Open, High, Low, and Close prices
- Trading Volume
- Technical Indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, etc.)
- Fundamental Data (if available)

The dataset covers a specific time period and includes data for one or more stocks or indices.

## EDA Findings

Through the EDA process, the following insights were uncovered:

1. **[Key Finding 1]**: Describe a significant finding or pattern observed in the data.
2. **[Key Finding 2]**: Highlight another important insight or relationship discovered during the analysis.
3. **[Key Finding 3]**: Mention any other relevant findings or observations.

These findings will inform the feature selection and modeling process for stock price prediction.

## Usage

To replicate the EDA process and findings, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/akadve/Stock_Prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd stock-price-prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
5. Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the EDA process and visualizations.
